# Project Status and Next Steps

This document summarizes the current state of the Media Recommender project and outlines the planned next steps based on the README and existing documentation.

## Current State

* **Data Pipeline:**
  * ETL pipeline implemented (`src/anime_scraper.py`, `src/data_processing_anime.py`).
  * Handles extraction from sources, transformation/cleaning (dates, genres, text), and loading into processed formats (Parquet, CSV, Pickle).
  * Corresponds to the completed "Data collection and processing pipeline" step in `README.md`.
* **Core Architecture Design:**
  * High-level goal: Combine content-based filtering (categorical/numerical features) and semantic similarity (NLP on descriptions).
  * Detailed technical design for the semantic similarity component exists (`docs/design_documentation.md`).
* **Semantic Similarity Implementation:**
  * Modular components built using abstract classes (`src/abstract_interface_classes.py`).
  * Embedding models implemented (`src/embedding_model.py`), defaulting to Sentence Transformers.
  * Vector database interface implemented (`src/vector_database.py`), primarily using Milvus.
  * Recommendation engine (`src/recommendation_engine.py`) integrates embeddings and vector search with caching.
  * Configuration managed by Hydra (`config/`).
  * Docker environment for Milvus defined (`docker-compose.yml`) and documented (`docs/docker_milvus_setup.md`).
  * Basic Milvus integration tests exist (`tests/test_milvus_integration.py`, `docs/milvus_integration_tests.md`).
* **Content Filtering Implementation:**
  * Mentioned as a goal in `README.md`.
  * Specific design, feature engineering, and model implementation appear incomplete or not yet integrated.
* **Documentation:**
  * Initial technical design (`docs/design_documentation.md`).
  * Setup guides (`docs/docker_milvus_setup.md`).
  * Test notes (`docs/milvus_integration_tests.md`).
  * README provides project overview and high-level progress.

## Next Steps

Based on the `README.md` project progress checklist and the current implementation state:

1. **Design & Implement Content Filtering Model:**
    * Finalize the specific algorithms and approach for recommendations based on categorical/numerical features.
    * Perform feature engineering tailored to the chosen content filtering model(s).
    * Implement the content filtering model logic within the `src` directory.
2. **Integrate Models:**
    * Define how results from the content filtering and semantic similarity models will be combined (e.g., ranking, blending scores).
    * Implement this integration logic, potentially within the `RecommendationEngine` or a new coordinating module.
3. **Develop Recommendation System Query Engine:**
    * Create the primary interface (e.g., API, command-line tool) for users to get recommendations.
    * This engine should accept user input/preferences and utilize the integrated models. `client.py` could be expanded or serve as a basis.
4. **Evaluation:**
    * Define relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., precision@k, recall@k, NDCG, diversity).
    * Implement evaluation scripts/notebooks using appropriate data splits or historical data.
    * Evaluate individual models and the final integrated system.
5. **Refinement & Testing:**
    * Increase test coverage (unit and integration tests) for all major components (`data_processing`, `embedding_model`, `vector_database`, `recommendation_engine`, content filtering model, query engine).
    * Implement robust logging and error handling throughout the application.
6. **Deployment:**
    * Choose a deployment strategy (e.g., Docker container, cloud service).
    * Implement the necessary configurations and scripts for deployment.
7. **Documentation Update:**
    * Update `README.md` progress checklist.
    * Add design details for the content filtering model and integration strategy to `docs/design_documentation.md`.
    * Document the usage of the query engine/API.
    * Ensure setup and contribution guides are clear and up-to-date.
